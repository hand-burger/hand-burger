## Hey there, im jack ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at the University of Toronto and software developer specializing in object oriented progamming with languages like C++ as well as python.

Right now, I'm currently interested in improving my React and Competitive Programming skills as well as learning about OpenCV, algorithms & data structures.
